remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it 
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a 
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made 
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that 
the Source Code version remains available even if the 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>
<br>
     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You 
contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to 
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must 
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, 
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 
Developer and including the name of the<br>
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in 
any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in 
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
a third party's intellectual property rights is required to 
exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 
or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and 
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a 
recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such 
knowledge after the Modification is made  available as described in 
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in 
all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall 
take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
<br>
          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>
          If Contributor's Modifications include an 
application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of 
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that 
API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL 
file.<br>
     <br>
          (c)    Representations.<br>
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that 
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or 
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
License.<br>
<br>
     3.5. Required Notices.<br>
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each 
file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such 
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant 
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If 
You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name 
as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You 
must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the 
Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership 
rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to 
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may 
do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the 
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or  liability 
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify 
the Initial Developer and every  Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form 
only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for 
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the 
Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the 
terms of this License, including a description of how and where 
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice 
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable 
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the 
Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license 
of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this 
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not 
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code 
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must 
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or 
any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms 
You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.7. Larger Works.<br>
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You 
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled 
for the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the 
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You 
must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum 
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code 
they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file 
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions 
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed 
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
     This License applies to code to which the Initial 
Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered 
Code. <br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
     6.1. New Versions.<br>
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may 
publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to 
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a 
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it 
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such 
Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created 
under this License.<br>
<br>
     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
     If You create or use a modified version of this 
License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which 
is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You 
must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", 
"MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly 
similar phrase do not appear in your     license (except to note 
that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise 
make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms 
which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public 
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original 
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall 
not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 
License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS 
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED 
CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE 
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL  DEVELOPER 
OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY 
SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder 
will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms 
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which 
are properly granted shall survive any termination of this 
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against 
Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as 
"Participant")  alleging that:<br>
<br>
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly 
or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 
this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay  Participant a 
mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use 
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw 
Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version 
against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed 
upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not 
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 
and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day 
notice period specified above.<br>
<br>
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than 
such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as 
of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had 
made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br>
<br>
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim 
against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor 
Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the 
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable 
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 
2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.<br>
<br>
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 
or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or 
any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive 
termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, 
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL 
YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER  CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE 
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF 
SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR  PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION 
MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term 
is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
     This License represents the complete agreement 
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is 
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only 
to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License 
shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the 
extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its 
conflict-of-law provisions.  With respect to disputes in which at 
least one party is a citizen of, <br>
or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the 
United States of America, any litigation relating to this  License 
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the 
Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara 
County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, 
including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' 
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the 
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall 
not apply to this License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, 
each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,  
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this 
License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. 
Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any 
admission of liability.<br>
<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
<br>
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the 
Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means 
that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of 
the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the 
alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the 
file described in Exhibit A. <br>
